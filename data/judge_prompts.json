    "creativity": "Given the model output above, assess the creativity of the proposed modifications.\n\nSome examples of creative modifications include but are not limited to: \n- Adding a spacer in the middle of the sequence \n- Deleting a large portion of the sequence WHILE PRESERVING FUNCTIONALITY\n- Removing a protease binding site\n- Replacing helix-terminal residues with stabilizing alternatives to enhance helix stability (helix capping) \n- Adding or Removing a common tag found in literature\n\nLess \"creative\" modifications would be those of simple point mutations. \n\nRate the creativity of the proposed modifications either 0, 1, or 2, with 0 being the least creative and 2 being the most creative. An unintelligible response will be scored as 0.\n\nYour response should ONLY BE \"\\score{0}\" OR \"\\score{1}\" OR \"\\score{2}\" AND NOTHING ELSE.",

    "specificity": "Given the model output above, assess the specificity of the reasoning provided by the model in relation to the enzyme. \n\nFor example, reasoning that is specific to the enzyme will include discussion of the enzyme's specific reaction, pathways the enzyme is involved in, literature concerning the enzyme, specific structural elements of the enzyme, and effects of known mutations on the enzyme.\n\nReasoning that is not specific will include general statements about enzymes, general statements about protein structure and function, and a lack of discussion of the enzyme beyond the name and the reaction it catalyzes.\n\nRate the specificity of the reasoning either 0, 1, or 2, with 0 being the least specific and 2 being the most. An unintelligible response will be scored as 0.\n\nYour response should ONLY BE \"\\score{0}\" OR \"\\score{1}\" OR \"\\score{2}\" AND NOTHING ELSE.",

    "compliance": "Based on the original and modified sequences provided (both indexed) and the reasoning output by the model, determine whether or not the modifications match the reasoning provided by the model. It may help to first identify all of the differences between the original and modified sequence. Then examine the reasoning to find mutations proposed by the model and determine whether or not they match the differences identified.\n\nFor example, if the model proposes a modification to position 100, but the modified sequence shows no change at position 100, then the modification is not correct. If the reasoning suggests a modification to 'G' but the modified sequence shows a modification to 'A', then the modification is not correct. And finally, if there are differences between the original and modified sequence that were not proposed in the reasoning, then the modification is not correct.\n\nIf ALL of the modifications match the reasoning provided by the model, INCLUDE \"\\score{2}\" IN YOUR RESPONSE. If SOME of the modifications match the reasoning provided by the model, INCLUDE \"\\score{1}\" IN YOUR RESPONSE. If NONE of the modifications match the reasoning provided by the model, INCLUDE \"\\score{0}\" IN YOUR RESPONSE."
