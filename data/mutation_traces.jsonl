RS-SPASM proteins are comprised of a prototypical TIM barrel fold which binds the RS [4Fe-4S] cluster involved in the homolytic cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In addition, they contain an elongated C-terminal SPASM domain which binds up to two additional auxiliary [Fe-S] clusters. The cluster proximal to the RS cluster (annotated as Aux I) is typically a [4Fe-4S] (with the exception of PqqE in which a [2Fe-2S] cluster is reported) and the distal cluster (designated as Aux II) is a [4Fe-4S] cluster. MftC is a RS-SPASM enzyme that performs the first modifying step in the biosynthesis of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), mycofactocin. The ability of MftC to redox-flip, or accommodate both oxidative to redox neutral reactions, is certainly unique to the RS-SPASM subfamily. The Aux I and Aux II clusters are required for catalysis, consistent with results shown for QhpD, AnSME, SCIFF, and PqqE <3>; #3# the enzyme belongs to the PqqE-like rSAM protein family, part of the radical SAM domain superfamily. Members occur clustered with a well-conserved small polypeptide mycofactocin, similar in size to bacteriocins and PqqA, precursor of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Partial phylogenetic profiling identifies the mycofactocin cluster. The mycofactocin precursor is modified by the gene Rv0693 family rSAM protein and other enzymes in its cluster. Rv0693 belongs to a branch of the radical SAM family in which known or presumed substrates are short peptides.
