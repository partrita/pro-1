The inhibition results in a systematic decrease in steady-state velocity and makes the lag appear to have a second-order dependence on enzyme concentration.The lag is in fact due to a substrate and cofactor-induced isomerization of the enzyme. The cofactor binds to the enzyme']\nSUBSTRATES: UDP-glucose, 2 NAD+, H2O\nPRODUCTS: UDP-glucuronate, 2 NADH, 2 H+\nMETALS/IONS: None\nKNOWN MUTATIONS AND EFFECTS:\n- D280A: extremely poor enzymic activity\n- E110A: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant, although dimeric in the apo form, exhibits only about 50% reduction in Vmax, but is highly unstable in solution and in cultured cells so it cannot be evaluated unambiguously\n- G13E: normal expression and stability of mutant, no enzymic activity, no photoaffinity labeling with nicotinamide 2-azidoadenosine dinucleotide\n- N224A: steady-state kinetic parameters are within an order of magnitude of the native enzyme\n- A44V: mutation is the genetic cause of a developmental epileptic encephalopathy in a consanguineous Palestinian family with three affected siblings. The A44V variant is also found in two additional families from Puerto Rico and from Spain\n- K94E: mutation in the hexamer-building interface, generates a stable enzyme dimer. 160fold decrease in kcat value\n- E161Q: hydrolysis step becomes completely rate-limiting so that a thioester enzyme intermediate accumulates at steady state. Crystallization of E161Q in the presence of 5 mM UDP-glucose and 2 mM NAD\u0001 results in trapping a thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate\n- T325D: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant yields exclusively dimeric species. The T325D mutant is significantly less efficient in promoting downstream hyaluronan production by HEK293 cells than the wild-type. UGDH T325D retains its activity similarly to the wild-type enzyme but does not exhibit increased stability in the abortive ternary complex\n- DELTA132: deletion of residue Val132 from the Thr131 loop to approximate an intermediate state in the allosteric transition. The crystal structure of the deletion construct reveals an open conformation that relaxes steric constraints and facilitates repacking of the protein core. The open conformation stabilizes the construct as a hexamer with point group symmetry 32, similar to that of the active complex. The DELTA132 and UDP-alpha-D-xylose-inhibited structures have similar hexamer-building interfaces\n- T131S: steady-state kinetic parameters are within an order of magnitude of the native enzyme\n- T325A: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant occurs as dimeric species that can be induced to form hexamers in the ternary complex with substrate and cofactor. The inducible hexamer shows that upon increasing enzyme concentration, which favors the hexameric species, activity is modestly decreased and exhibits cooperativity. The T325A mutant is significantly less efficient in promoting downstream hyaluronan production by HEK293 cells than the wild-type. The activity of the T325A mutant is the most labile, with a half-life of only 24 h that is not extended significantly by substrate and cofactor addition\n- A136M: mutant does not exhibit substrate cooperativity. The inhibitor affinity of A136M is reduced 14fold and does not exhibit hysteresis. Substitution disrupts NAD+-induced negative cooperativity\n- A104L: ubstitution introduced to fill a cavity in the E state and sterically prevent repacking of the core into the inactive Eomega state. Mutant A104L does not show hysteresis or negative cooperativity, binds UDP-xylose with lower affinity and the inhibition is no longer cooperative\n- C276A: is a hexamer-dimer mixture\n- K220A: shows, exclusively, a hexameric quaternary structure in solution\n- K279A: no enzymic activity, affinity for NAD+ similar to wild-type, almost exclusively found as dimer\n- C276S: no enzymic activity, affinity for NAD+ similar to wild-type, retains predominantly hexameric structure\n- D280N: shows, exclusively, a hexameric quaternary structure in solution\n- K339A: is a dimer\n- A222Q/S233G: is a dimer in solution\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

Mutation also results in a slow conversion of the 8-CH3-substituent of FMN to yield 8-formyl-FMN\n- R181K: mutation in conserved residue, efficiency of reduction of the oxidized flavin by L-lactate is greatly reduced\n- R181M: mutation in conserved residue, efficiency of reduction of the oxidized flavin by L-lactate is greatly reduced\n- R181K/R268K: mutation in conserved residue, efficiency of reduction of the oxidized flavin by L-lactate is greatly reduced\n- A95G: activity with L-lactate similar to wild-type, increased activity with longer chain L-alpha-hydroxyacids such as alpha-hydroxy-n-butyric acid, alpha-hydroxy-n-valeric acid, and also with L-mandelic acid. Reduction of the enzyme bound flavin by substrates is the rate-limiting step in A95G\n- Y191A: 28fold decrease in release of pyruvate, , binding of L-lactate is strongly affected\n- Y215F: mutation in binding pocket, mutant shows slowed flavin reduction and oxidation by up to 33-fold. Pyruvate release is also decelerated and is the slowest step overall\n- Y191L: 19fold decrease in release of pyruvate, binding of L-lactate is strongly affected\n- Y191F: 4.7fold decrease in release of pyruvate\n- Y215H Y215F: mutation in binding pocket, mutant shows slowed flavin reduction and oxidation by up to 33-fold. Pyruvate release is also decelerated\n- S218C: introduction of a site for chemical modification, about 50% of wild-type activity\n- A96L: engineering the enzyme in order to minimize the effects of oxygen interference on sensor strips. Mutant A96L shows a drastic reduction in oxidase activity using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor and a small increase in dehydrogenase activity employing an artificial electron acceptor. After immobilization on a screen-printed carbon electrode and under argon or atmospheric conditions, the response current increases linearly from 0.05 to 0.5 mM L-lactate for both wild-type and mutant A96L. Under atmospheric conditions, the response of wild-type electrode is suppressed by 9-12% due to oxygen interference. The mutant maintains 56-69% of the response current at the same L-lactate level and minimizes the relative bias error to -19% from -49% of wild-type\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

The lipoxygenases (LOs) are principal enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid. 12- and 15-LO and their lipid metabolites are implicated in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Adipose tissue, and in particular visceral adipose tissue, plays a primary role in the development of the inflammation seen in these conditions. 12- and 15-LO and their lipid metabolites act as upstream regulators of many of the cytokines involved in the inflammatory response in adipose tissue. 12- and 15-LO and their lipid metabolites act as upstream regulators of many of the cytokines involved in the inflammatory response in adipose tissue. Significant role for 12- and 15-LO function in white adipose tissue adipogenesis and adipocyte health. 12- and 15-LO function in adipogenesis and has anti-inflammatory roles in adipose tissue, detailed overview. Leukocyte-type 12-LO, or 12/15-LO appears to be a key player in the progression of adipocyte dysfunction and resultant systemic decline. 12/15-LO is upregulated in white adipose tissue in the obese state. Increased expression of all of the 12- and 15-LO enzyme isoforms in omental vs. subcutaneous white adipose tissue suggests that the pathways may contribute to the proinflammatory milieu prominently associated with visceral fat in obesity. The potent vasoconstricting and pro-inflammatory hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) led to increases in leukocyte-type 12-LO mRNA and protein levels, as well as increased enzyme activity <144>; #32# enzyme LoxA is a poor catalyst against phosphoester fatty acids, suggesting that LoxA is not involved in membrane decomposition. LoxA also does not react with 5- or 15-HETEs, indicating poor involvement in lipoxin production. The level of LoxA expression is increased when Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes the transition to a biofilm mode of growth, but LoxA is not required for biofilm growth on abiotic surfaces.

Jhd2 regulates rDNA recombination through the Tof2/Csm1/Lrs4 pathway and prevents excessive recruitment of Tof2, Csm1/Lrs4 and condensin subunits to the replication fork barrier site within the NTS1 region. The demethylase activity of Jhd2 regulates telomeric silencing and mitotic rDNA condensation and rDNA repeat stability and rDNA silencing in a Sir2-independent manner by maintaining Csm1/Lrs4 and condensin association with rDNA regions during mitosis. Jhd2 is the only JmjC demethylase that contributes to the regulation of rDNA silencing and acts through a pathway that is independent of Net1 and Sir2, but through a Tof2/Csm1/Lrs4 pathway. Jhd2-mediated alleviation of excessive Csm1/Lrs4 or condensin at the NTS1 region of rDNA is required for the integrity of rDNA repeats and proper rDNA silencing during mitosis. The role of yeast JmjC-demethylases in regulating telomeric silencing is not restricted to Jhd2. The effect of Jhd2 on rDNA silencing is independent on the enzymatic activity of Jhd2 <24>; #22# histone H3K4 methylation is linked to transcriptional activation. KDM5A, a histone H3K4 demethylase, physically interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes, and KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively regulate H3K4me2/3 levels. CHD4 modulates H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and coding regions of target genes <31>; #21# histone H3K4 methylation is linked to transcriptional activation. KDM5A, a histone H3K4 demethylase, physically interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes. Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of KDM5, RBR-2, and CHD4 functions cooperatively with NuRD in vulval development, functional interaction between KDM5 and the NuRD complex during developmental processes <31>; #20# histone lysine demethylase KDM5B regulates gene transcription and cell differentiation and is implicated in carcinogenesis <27>; #25# histone lysine methylation is an important epigenetic modification for gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Increased JMJ15 levels may regulate the gene expression program that enhances stress tolerance <30>; #17# LSD1 modulates gene expression through demethylation of either H3K4 or H3K9. H3K9 methylation usually suppresses transcription, whereas H3K4 methylation generally activates transcription. H3K4 methylation is a critical epigenetic marker of transcriptional activation. Lysine-specific demethylase 1-mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 9, but not lysine 4, contributes to interleukin 1beta-induced microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES-1) expression in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Levels of di- and trimethylated H3K4 are significantly enhanced after 4 h of interleukin-1beta stimulation, reach a maximum at 12 h, persist through 24 h and decrease at 48 h. In contrast, the level of monomethylated H3K4 remain almost unchanged following interleukin-1beta stimulation. The increase in H3K4 di- and trimethylation by interleukin-1beta at the mPGES-1 promoter paralleles the increased transcription of mPGES-1, suggesting that, in addition to H3K9 demethylation, H3K4 methylation also contributes to interleukin-1beta-induced mPGES-1 expression, the induction of mPGES-1 by interleukin-1beta is associated with H3K4 methylation <22>; #15# retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (Rbp2) is a H3K4me3 demethylase that interacts with Piasy, a Pias (protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription) family member, which possesses the ability to suppress IFNI transcriptions in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

The M374G/S375G mutation, designated Tyr-GG, replaces two residues present in mTyr by the equivalent residues in mTyrp1 and could potentially modify the enzymatic properties of the protein, when compared with wild-type Tyr. Analysis of the behaviour of the individual mutants M374G and S374G indicates that loss of enzymatic activity in Tyr-GG is mostly because of the M374G mutation\n- M374G: potential to delete the enzymatic activity of Tyr. Major effect on the active site: the packing density of this normally rigid environment is significantly lowered when the original amino acid is mutated to the smaller glycine because the missing side chain of G374 can neither anchor the loop nor orient the side chain of H367\n- S375G: potential to delete the enzymatic activity of Tyr\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

BCKDH is a multienzyme complex made up of three components, E1, E2, and E3. E1 is a heterotetramer composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits, encoded by BCKDHA and BCKDHB, respectively. Despite being essential, BCAAs are surprisingly abundant and make up about 35% of essential amino acids and 18% of all amino acids in animal protein. Because BCAAs are essential, animals must balance their intake and loss. All intake comes from diet, and loss occurs through oxidation. The relative abundance of BCAAs in protein is almost always 2.2', 'elevated phosphorylation, and lower activity, of liver BCKDH in various models of diabetes. The decreased liver BCAA oxidation is likely mediated by post-translational inhibition of BCKDH via phosphorylation. When fed a BCAA-restricted diet, fatty acyl-CoA content in the skeletal muscle of rats decreases and insulin resistance is improved. The expression of BCAA catabolic genes has been shown to be reduced in tissue from rodent and human failing hearts <4>; #9# genetic deletion in mice of BCKDHA or of a BCAA transporter specifically in brown fat is sufficient to raise plasma BCAAs. Elevated phosphorylation, and lower activity, of liver BCKDH in various models of diabetes. The decreased liver BCAA oxidation is likely mediated by post-translational inhibition of BCKDH via phosphorylation. The expression of BCAA catabolic genes has been shown to be reduced in tissue from rodent and human failing hearts <4>; #7# inactivating homozygous mutations in the gene encoding BCKD kinase (BCKDK) have been identified in families with autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability by whole exome sequencing. Affected patients show reduced plasma level of branched-chain amino acids. Disease-causing mutations in the genes encoding the subunits E1alpha, E1beta, E2, and E3 of the BCKD complex have been identified to cause the Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an autosomal recessive disorder usually diagnosed by newborn screening. Mutations in the subunits E1alpha, E1beta, and E2 cause MSUD types 1A, 1B, and 2, respectively. Mutations in the E3 subunit cause multiple dehydrogenase deficiency, as E3 is the subunit shared by the three 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (PDH, 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and BCKD).

RS-SPASM proteins are comprised of a prototypical TIM barrel fold which binds the RS [4Fe-4S] cluster involved in the homolytic cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In addition, they contain an elongated C-terminal SPASM domain which binds up to two additional auxiliary [Fe-S] clusters. The cluster proximal to the RS cluster (annotated as Aux I) is typically a [4Fe-4S] (with the exception of PqqE in which a [2Fe-2S] cluster is reported) and the distal cluster (designated as Aux II) is a [4Fe-4S] cluster. MftC is a RS-SPASM enzyme that performs the first modifying step in the biosynthesis of the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP), mycofactocin. The ability of MftC to redox-flip, or accommodate both oxidative to redox neutral reactions, is certainly unique to the RS-SPASM subfamily. The Aux I and Aux II clusters are required for catalysis, consistent with results shown for QhpD, AnSME, SCIFF, and PqqE <3>; #3# the enzyme belongs to the PqqE-like rSAM protein family, part of the radical SAM domain superfamily. Members occur clustered with a well-conserved small polypeptide mycofactocin, similar in size to bacteriocins and PqqA, precursor of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Partial phylogenetic profiling identifies the mycofactocin cluster. The mycofactocin precursor is modified by the gene Rv0693 family rSAM protein and other enzymes in its cluster. Rv0693 belongs to a branch of the radical SAM family in which known or presumed substrates are short peptides. The Rv0693 family radical SAM protein modifies the TIGR03969 family peptide to produce a bioactive molecule']\nSUBSTRATES: C-terminal [mycofactocin precursor peptide]-glycyl-L-valyl-4-[2-aminoethenyl]phenol, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, AH2\nPRODUCTS: C-terminal [mycofactocin precursor peptide]-glycyl-3-amino-5-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-4 4-dimethylpyrrolidin-2-one, 5'-deoxyadenosine, L-methionine, A\nMETALS/IONS: None\nKNOWN MUTATIONS AND EFFECTS:\n- C323A: auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster I mutant, capable of catalyzing the reductive cleavage of SAM to form dAdo, incapable of converting MftA to MftA* or MftA**\n- C341A: site-directed mutagenesis, an Aux II KO variant mutant\n- C251A: insoluble\n- C310A: site-directed mutagenesis, an Aux II KO variant mutant\n- C269A: auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster I mutant, capable of catalyzing the reductive cleavage of SAM to form dAdo but incapable of converting MftA to MftA* or MftA**\n- C258A: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant shows no altered phenotype\n- C30A/C37A: radical S-adenosylmethionine mutant, can neither cleave SAM nor modify MftA\n- C30A/C34A/C37A: site-directed mutagenesis, insoluble mutant\n- C269A/C323A: insoluble\n- C310A/C341A: auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster II mutant, capable of catalyzing the reductive cleavage of SAM to form dAdo, incapable of converting MftA to MftA* or MftA**\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD) occurs due to mutations of electron transfer flavoprotein-dehydrogenase, including c.250G>A, c.380T>A, c.770A>G, c.1601C>T, and c.524G>A. Lipid storage myopathy (LSM) is a genetically heterogeneous group with variable clinical phenotypes. Late-onset multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD) is a rather common form of LSM in China, phenotypewith neuromuscular disorders, overview <31>; #15,16# depletion of enzyme ETFDH leads to growth inhibition in Burkholderia cenocepacia. In the DELTAetfdh2 mutant strain, growth is unaffected as long as gene etfdh1 is expressed, but falls to 13% of wild-type activity in the absence of rhamnose, suggesting that gene etfdh2 partially complements gene etfdh1. The morphology seen when EtfAB or ETF dehydrogenase is depleted is not due to a general defect of respiration <35>; #14# impairment of lysine-specific reduction of ETF reduces the ability of AtETF to mediate electron transfer between ETF-dependent dehydrogenases and ETF-QO <32>; #12# multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric acidemia type 2 (GA2), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder whose biochemical abnormalities result from a deficiency of one of the two electron transfer flavoproteins (ETF and ETFDH) that transfer electrons from acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain. Bezafibrate (BEZ) is a hypolipidemic drug that is as an agonist of the peroxisome proliferating activator receptor, and is beneficial in Japanese children with ETFDH gene mutations exhibiting GA2. BEZ, L-carnitine, and riboflavin each show partial effectiveness and produce partial remission in a patient with GA2. The disorder affects multiple metabolic pathways involving branched amino acids, fatty acids, and tryptophan, and results in a variety of distinctive organic acids being discharged. The heterogeneous clinical features of patients with GA2 fall into three subclasses']\nSUBSTRATES: reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein, ubiquinone\nPRODUCTS: electron-transferring flavoprotein, ubiquinol\nMETALS/IONS: None\nKNOWN MUTATIONS AND EFFECTS:\n- I31T: neutral naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no effect on enzyme activity or expression, occurs together with other mutantions, overview\n- Y49C: heterozygous, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- D218N: heterozygous, with a deletion on the other allele, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- S82F/D218N: mutations on different alleles, naturally occurring mutations of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, reduced antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- S82P/H346R: mutations on different alleles, naturally occurring mutations of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- R452K: homozygous, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II\n- R41X/L138R: mutations on different alleles, naturally occurring mutations of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II\n- L334P/Q222P: mutations on different alleles, naturally occurring mutations of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II\n- L334P: homo- or heterozygous, the latter with a deletion on the other allele, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, reduced antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- P562L: heterozygous, with a deletion on the other allele, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- L262F: homozygous, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- W182X/P456L: mutations on different alleles, naturally occurring mutations of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, reduced antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- G611E: homozygous, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- M1T: homo- and heterozygous, the latter with a deletion on the other allele, naturally occurring mutation of gene ETF:QO in patients with glutaric acidemia type II, no antigen detected in fibroblasts\n- A84T/S307C: mutations identified in a chinese woman with late-onset glutaric aciduria type II.

DMSOR family enzymes have been classified by type, with type II/III enzymes being characterized by [(PDT)2MoVIO(OSer/Asp)]- oxidized active sites that possess N- and S-oxide reductase activity. Type III Rhodobacter capsulatus DMSOR catalyzes the reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as part of the global sulfur cycle <34>; #10# dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR) represents the canonical member of the DMSOR family of prokaryotic pyranopterin molybdenum enzymes. DMSOR family enzymes have been classified by type, with type II/III enzymes being characterized by [(PDT)2MoVIO(OSer/Asp)]- oxidized active sites that possess N- and S-oxide reductase activity. Type III Rhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR catalyzes the reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as part of the global sulfur cycle <34>; #1# respiratory enzyme members of the DMSOR family such as nitrate reductase (NR, EC 1.9.6.1), dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR, EC 1.8.5.3), trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TMAOR, EC 1.7.2.3), and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) contribute to this broad diversity. The DMSOR family of enzymes has diverse active sites that vary in the first coordination sphere of the molybdenum center. Many enzymes in the DMSOR family use oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions for substrate transformation, e.g. periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) and respiratory nitrate reductase (Nar) reduce nitrate to nitrite, TMAOR reduces TMAO to TMA, and DMSOR reduces DMSO to dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Enzymes that catalyze the same reaction, such as Nap and Nar, have different molybdenum coordination spheres. In NapA, molybdenum is coordinated by a cysteine residue in the 5th position and an oxo or a sulfido group in the 6th <37>; #9# the DMSO reductases family cofactor is the bis-molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotide (Bis-MGD) and it is composed by two pyranopterin molecules (instead of one pyranopterin as in sulfite oxidases and xanthine oxidases families), which are conjugated with nucleosides']\nSUBSTRATES: dimethylsulfoxide, menaquinol\nPRODUCTS: dimethylsulfide, menaquinone, H2O\nMETALS/IONS: None\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

The engineered promiscuous enzyme MOMT5 is built by remodelling of its substrate binding pocket by the addition of four substitutions, i.e. M26H, S30R, V33S, and T319M, yielding a mutant enzyme capable of discriminately etherifying the para-hydroxyl of coniferyl alcohol even in the presence of excess sinapyl alcohol. The engineered enzyme variant has a substantially reduced substrate binding pocket that imposes a clear steric hindrance thereby excluding bulkier lignin precursors\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above. Ensure that you preserve the activity or function of the enzyme as much as possible. For each proposed mutation, explain your reasoning and consider:\n1.

Methyltransferase aTrm5a/Taw22 likely catalyzes two distinct reactions', 'archaeal Trm5a, a member of the archaeal Trm5a/b/c family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the wyosine derivatives, division of the family aTrm5 into three subfamilies aTrm5a (further divided into Taw21 and Taw22 which are monofunctional and bifunctional aTrm5a), aTrm5b, and aTrm5c. While the enzymes belonging to these subfamilies do not significantly differ in their AdoMet-binding site, small differences have been observed within the NPPY motif, which, in certain amino-methyltransferases, is involved in the positioning of the target nitrogen atom. In contrast, the N-terminal sequences of the aforementioned enzymes differ substantially, e.g. a small conservative domain called D1 is present in aTrm5b and aTrm5c but absent in most of the aTrm5a proteins.

Mutant has less than 1% of the in vitro activity of the wild-type enzyme and leads to the formation of cyclopropanated fatty acid methyl esters and of new C17 methyl-branched unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. The double bond of the latters is located at different positions 8, 9 or 10, and the methyl group at position 10 or 9. The reaction catalyzed by G236E mutant thus starts by the methylation of the unsaturated acyl chain at position 10 or 9 yielding a carbocation at position 9 or 10 respectively. It follows then two competing steps, a normal cyclopropanation or hydride shift/elimination events giving different combinations of alkenes\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

A massive formation of lipid bodies and a change in lipid pattern is observed simultaneously <102>; #4# the enzyme interacts with lipid droplets presumably to catalyze localized triacylglycerol synthesis for lipid droplet expansion <120>; #96,108,114,120# analysis of functional and cellular nature of type 1 and type 2 DGATs from Lobosphaera incisa, with LiDGAT1 being a major contributor to the TAG pool. LiDGATs of type 2 might be in turn involved in the incorporation of unusual fatty acids into TAG and thus regulate the composition of TAG <135>; #51# DGAT1 appears to play a role in freezing and/or drought stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. DGAT1 is suggested to be involved in maintaining a balance of DAG and acyl-CoA for the biosynthesis of membrane lipids and recycling of fatty acids to TAG under conditions where catabolic reactions are halted. Regulation of the enzyme, overview <149>; #88# DGAT1 appears to play a role in freezing and/or drought stress responses in Brassica napus. Regulation of the enzyme, overview <149>; #142# DGAT1 confers freezing tolerance in plants by supporting SFR2 (sensitive-to-freezing2)-mediated remodeling of chloroplast membranes, recombinant overexpression of AtDGAT1 leads to increased freezing tolerance in seedlings <162>; #53# DGAT2 catalyzes the formation of triacylglycerol (TG) using fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) as substrates. TG is the major form of stored metabolic energy in eukaryotic organisms that is sequestered in the hydrophobic core of cytosolic lipid droplets until it is needed. DGAT-2 catalyzes TG synthesis for lipid droplet growth <165>; #100,128# diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is an acyl-CoA-dependent enzyme which converts diacylglycerol (DAG) to triacylglycerol (TAG) <157>; #4# diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is a key enzyme in the production of triacylglycerols <137>; #88# diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acylcoenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). Proposed model for BnaDGAT1 regulation involving the hydrophilic N-terminal domain (NTD), overview <160>; #143# enzyme AtfG25 has an important, but not exclusive, role in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in the Streptomyces sp. G25 isolate, suggesting the presence of alternative metabolic pathways for lipid accumulation <131>; #88# intrinsic disorder in plant proteins has been reported to be essential for the stress response. An intrinsically disordered region (IDR) spanning the N-terminal cytosolic domain of the intramembrane enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase1 (DGAT1) from canola-type Brassica napus, has been identified. The IDR spans amino acid residues 1-80, while residues 81-113 have a folded structure. DGAT1 (EC 2.3.1.20) catalyzes the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent acylation of sn-1, 2-diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce triacylglycerol (TAG) and CoA. TAG serves as an energy source for germination in plants, a component of edible oil. This enzyme has a substantial effect on carbon flux into seed oil <167>; #48# isozyme GmDGAT1A may play a role in usual seed triacylglycerol (TAG) production. Isozymes GmDGAT1A and 2D are differentially regulated by jasmonate during insect and wounding responses and abscisic acid for cold and heat stress response, indicating their different functions in soybean stress responses <166>; #95# isozyme GmDGAT2D plays a role in usual seed triacylglycerol (TAG) production and is also involved in other tissues in responses to environmental and hormonal cues. Isozymes GmDGAT1A and 2D are differentially regulated by jasmonate during insect and wounding responses and abscisic acid for cold and heat stress response, indicating their different functions in soybean stress responses. Ectopic expression of GmDGATs in soybean hairy roots promotes TAG accumulation <166>; #77,78# isozymes CrDGTT1, CrDGTT2 and CrDGTT3 possess distinct specificities toward acyl CoAs and diacylglycerols, and may work in concert spatially and temporally to synthesize diverse triacylglycerol (TAG) species in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii <155>; #119# isozymes CrDGTT1, CrDGTT2 and CrDGTT3 possess distinct specificities toward acyl CoAs and diacylglycerols, and may work in concert spatially and temporally to synthesize diverse triacylglycerol (TAG) species in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. rDGTT1 is shown to prefer prokaryotic lipid substrates and probably resides in both the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplast envelope, indicating its role in prokaryotic and eukaryotic TAG biosynthesis. Role of isozyme CrDGTT1 in TAG biosynthesis, overview <155>; #30# regardless of N availability, PtWS/DGAT exhibits a DGAT activity with a preference on saturated fatty acids.

Upregulation of CerS6 expression increases C16-ceramide generation at the expense of very long chain ceramides. Increased expression of acid ceramidase in response to CerS6 expression occurs via a JNK-AP1-dependent mechanism and is important for survival. Enzyme CerS6 may transcriptionally activate the expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1) <5>; #6# ceramide plays a role in the cell signaling pathway involved in apoptosis. Ceramide synthase is essential for endonuclease-mediated death of renal tubular epithelial cells induced by hypoxia reoxygenation. Mainly, enhanced ceramide generation is the result of hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinases. Role of ceramide synthase in enhanced ceramide generation, overview. Exposure of cells to hypoxia-reoxygenation results in a significant increase in ceramide synthase activity without any significant change in acid or neutral sphingomyelinase. Ceramide synthase-dependent ceramide generation is a key modulator of EndoG-mediated cytotoxicity in hypoxia-reoxygenation injury to renal tubular epithelial cells <6>; #16# ceramide synthase 6 modulates TRAIL sensitivity and nuclear translocation of active caspase-3 in colon cancer cells. Ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6 also known as longevity assurance homolog 6/LASS6) preferentially generates C16-ceramide and can influence TRAIL susceptibility. CerS6 may regulate events at the nuclear membrane and allow late stage apoptotic signaling <32>; #4,5# ceramide synthase mediates daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, an alternative mechanism for generating death signals. Ceramide synthesis appears obligatory for daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, since fumonisin B1, a natural specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase, blocks daunorubicin-induced ceramide elevation and apoptosis. Ceramide mimics daunorubicin in inducing apoptosis <16>; #15,16,20# ceramides are synthesized by ceramide synthases through the addition of a variable length fatty acid to the amine group of a sphingoid base. In mammalian cells, the sphingoid base used for de novo ceramide synthesis is usually the C18', 'due to the highly dynamic nature of sphingolipid metabolism, alterations in the expression of CerS6 may have impacts beyond increased generation of C16-ceramide <5>; #3# ceramide synthases use long-chain bases, sphinganine or sphingosine, and FA-CoAs with varying chain length to produce (dihydro)ceramide, which is a precursor metabolite for all sphingolipids <18>; #6# ceramide, a key intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism, is synthesized by acylation of sphinganine followed by dehydrogenation of dihydroceramide to ceramide <8>; #11# LASS5 expression alone reduces choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine by 26%, whereas coexpression of LASS5 with sphingomyelinase produces a nearly 40% reduction in phosphatidylcholine synthesis <27>; #15# regulation of CerS isozymes, overview. The interplay among the CerS proteins takes place in a stress stimulus-, cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific manner. CerS2 and CerS5 overexpression significantly alters apoptosis, determination of ionizing radiation-induced mitochondrial ceramide elevations via CerS2, 5, and 6, overview. CerS2 and CerS5 overexpressions defines opposing roles in radiation-induced mitochondrial apoptosis <17>; #16# regulation of CerS isozymes, overview. The interplay among the CerS proteins takes place in a stress stimulus-, cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific manner. CerS6 overexpression yields no significant differences in IR-induced apoptosis compared to empty vector-transfected cells. Determination of ionizing radiation-induced mitochondrial ceramide elevations via CerS2, 5, and 6, overview <17>; #15,16# regulation of sphingolipid metabolism by UV-C irradiation, overview. Ceramide species that are the least abundant (e.g. C18-Cer, C18', 'decreased enzyme expression induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in head and neck squamous carcinoma cells but not in A-549, MCF-7, or SW-480 cells, which are derived from lung, breast, and colon cancer, respectively, detailed overview <5>; #6# ceramide synthase-specific inhibitor fumonisin B1 suppresses hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced ceramide generation and provides protection against hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced EndoG release, DNA fragmentation, and cell death <6>; #16# CerS6 knockdown might decrease apoptosis compared to normal irradiated HeLa cells <17>; #6# disruption of the de novo pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis may be a critical in the diseases that have been associated with consumption of fumonisins. Fusarium moniliforme causes equine leucoencephalomalacia, porcine pulmonary edem syndrome, and liver cancer in rats <20>; #16# inhibition of CerS is able to protect from cell death. Moreover, this protection occurs downstream or independently of mitochondrial permeabilization. Inhibition of CerS greatly inhibits plasma membrane permeabilization. Combined knockdown of CerS5 and CerS6 is able to decrease long-chain ceramide accumulation and plasma membrane permeabilization. Individual CerS knockdown does not significantly inhibit total ceramide accumulation, CerS6 knockdown clearly decreases C14']\nSUBSTRATES: sphingosine, palmitoyl-CoA\nPRODUCTS: N-palmitoylsphingosine, CoA\nMETALS/IONS: None\nKNOWN MUTATIONS AND EFFECTS:\n- N285Q: site-directed mutagenesis, a putative glycosylation site mutant\n- H212A: site-directed mutagenesis\n- N18Q: site-directed mutagenesis, a glycosylation site mutant\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

The change affects protein structure and has a direct impact on the catalytic domain of the protein which abolishes embryo motility almost completely. Mutant fish display reduced embryonic motility from 24 hours post-fertilization onwards. The heart beats at normal rate at 48 hours post-fertilization but decreases over time and ceases around 5 days post-fertilization, resulting in death. The swim bladder fails to inflate. Heterozygotes do not exhibit any mobility or other obvious defects and become healthy adults\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above. Ensure that you preserve the activity or function of the enzyme as much as possible. For each proposed mutation, explain your reasoning and consider:\n1.

The patient with this ALG9 defect, who presents with developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and hepatomegaly\n- Y286C: patient, who is homozygous for the ALG9 mutation p.Y286C, deleterious effect Y286C on the ALG9 function. Compared the complementation efficiency of the wild-type and mutant ALG9 cDNA in yeast cells deficient for alg9. In an assay, the growth efficiency of the transformed yeast double mutant alg9 wbp1-2 is tested. Deficiency in lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis (alg9) in combination with reduced oligosaccharyltransferase activity (wbp1-2) results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype at 30\u00b0C. At this restrictive temperature, both the normal and mutant ALG9 cDNAs are able to restore growth. The HsALG9 transformants perform similar to the yeast alg9. The complementation with the mutant construct (HsALG9 (Y286C)) is less efficient, resulting is a reduced growth restoration. This difference becomes more prominent when the transformants are grown at 32\u00b0C. The hypoglycosylation of the alg9 yeast strain is reflected in the presence of CPY glycoforms lacking one or two N-linked oligosacharides. The human ALG9 cDNA complements the yeast mutation partially, as shown by the improved glycosylation of CPY. The complementation efficiency of the HsALG9 (Y286C) is less efficient and almost comparable to the empty vector\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

The patient is homozygous for the point mutation that causes an amino acid substitution in a conserved region of dolichyl-P-Man:Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl alpha6-mannosyltransferase. Skin biopsy fibroblasts from a CDG I patient have a reduced capacity to add the eighth mannose residue onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The fibroblasts of the patient are capable of the direct transfer of Man7GlcNAc2 from dolichol onto protein and that this N-linked structure can be glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum\n- T67M: congenital disorder of glycosylation type lg is identified in a child presenting with psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, growth retardation, dysmorphic features and anorexia. In the patient\u0092s fibroblasts, the biosynthetic intermediate GlcNAc2Man7 oligosaccharide is detected both on the lipid carrier dolichyl pyrophosphate and on newly synthesized glycoproteins, pointing to a defect in the dolichyl pyrophosphate\u0096GlcNAc2Man7-dependent ALG12 alpha1,6 mannosyltransferase. Analysis of the ALG12 cDNA in the CDG patient revealed compound heterozygosity for two point mutations that result in the amino acid substitutions T67M and R146Q, respectively. The impact of these mutations on ALG12 protein function is investigated in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg12 glycosylation mutant by showing that the yeast ALG12 gene bearing the homologous mutations T61M and R161Q and the human mutant ALG12 cDNA alleles fail to normalize the growth defect phenotype of the alg12 yeast model, whereas expression of the normal ALG12 cDNA complements the yeast mutation.

Al treatment dramatically decreases the content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and the ratio of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol to digalactosyldiacylglycerol in wild-type plants, while it is unchanged in transgenic plants. The stable monogalactosyldiacylglycerol level and the ratio of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol/digalactosyldiacylglycerol contribute to maintain the membrane stability and permeability. Al causes a significant increase in phospholipids in wild-type plants, resulting in a high proportion of phospholipids and low proportion of galactolipids, but these proportions are unaffected in transgenic plants <36>; #10# strong MGD1 suppression causes a 36% loss of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total protochlorophyllide content.

CoBa is a housekeeping enzyme involved in both the de novo biosynthesis and the salvage of adenosylcobalamin. The PduO adenosyl transferase is encoded in an operon (pdu) for cobalamin-dependent propanediol degradation and is induced by propanediol. Transferase EutT is encoded within the operon for ethanolamine utilization (eut). CobA produces sufficient Ado-B12 to initiate eut operon induction and to serve as a cofactor for EA-lyase when B12 levels are high. Once the eut operon is induced, the EutT transferase supplies more Ado-B12 during the period of high demand <7>; #1# lack of corrinoid adenosyltransferase CobA, Ec 2.5.1.17, and EutT blocks ethanolamine utilization.

This proves that berberine inhibits IKK beta activity through the modification of Cys179\n- D145A: site-directed mutagenesis, the IKK-2 is devoid of kinase activity despite its ability to bind ATP with high affinity and is not phosphorylated at the T loop. mutant binds a diverse collection of inhibitors with comparable binding affinities to wild-type IKK-2, inhibition by PHA-408 is reduced compared to the wild-type enzyme\n- C99S: the mutation partially abolishes (E)-2-methoxy-4-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-1-en-1-yl)phenol-induced cell growth inhibition and enhances expression of death receptors 5 and 6\n- Y169F: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant shows time-dependent inhibition by PHA-408 like the wild-type\n- F26A: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant has lost the time-dependent binding of inhibitor PHA-408\n- F26W: site-directed mutagenesis\n- K106Q: site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant shows time-dependent inhibition like the wild-type, inhibition by PHA-408 is slightly increased compared to the wild-type enzyme\n- DELTA1-734: deletion mutant containing only the 11-residues of the NEMO-binding region (NBD) is not sufficient for interaction with NEMO\n- DELTA1-640: deletion mutant containing residues 640-756, which contains the entire C-terminal region after the HLH domain, interacts well with NEMO\n- DELTA1-680: deletion mutant wich stably interacts with NEMO\n- DELTA1-705: deletion mutant comprising just the predicted alpha-helical and coiled-coil region and the NEMO binding domain (NPD) residues 734-745 is sufficient for a stable interaction with NEMO\n- DELTA307-384: mutant protein consisting of a deletion of the ubiquitin-like domain that is present only in IKKbeta fails to activate NFkappaB in response to IL-1 or TNF. Deletion mutant is incorporated into the IKK complex, indicating that this domain is not important for the intermolecular interaction between the IKKs and NEMO. Deletion mutant strongly associate with the NF-kappaB p65 subunit in the absence or presence of stimuli, whereas wild-type IKKbeta can not be detected in a complex with p65. This indicates that the to propose a model in which the ubiquitin-like domain plays a role in release of NF-kappaB following IkappaBalpha phosphorylation\n- L353X: L353 within the ubiquitin-like domain is necessary to activate NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. However, the L353 mutant is able to phosphorylate IkappaBalpha suggesting that the defect in NF-kappaB activation is not at the level of inhibition of IkappaB degradation\n- DELTA665-756: mutant lacking the serine rich and the NEMO-binding motif retains the ability to phosphorylate its substrate IkappaBalpha exclusively at serine positions 32 and 36\n- DELTA395-756: mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain, the helix-loop-helix domain, the serine rich and the NEMO-binding motif are capable to catalyze phosphotransfer to the substrate protein IkappaBalpha, but they do so at positions outside Ser-32 and Ser-36 while leaving these two critical amino acids unmodified. Removal of the leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix regions converts IKKbeta to monomer\n- DELTA395-756D145N: mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain, the helix-loop-helix domain, the serine rich and the NEMO-binding motif and containing a Asp145Asn mutation does not display any kinase activity\n- M96L: site-directed mutagenesis\n- K106N: site-directed mutagenesis\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

PPK2 mutant-infected guinea pigs have significantly reduced bacterial loads and tissue pathology in comparison to wild-type-infected guinea pigs at later stages of infection. In comparison to the wild-type strain, the PPK2 mutant strain is more tolerant to isoniazid and impaired for survival in THP-1 macrophages <10>; #1# Ppk2 is required for control of intrabacillary polyphosphate levels and optimal Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and survival in macrophages and mouse lungs. A Ppk2 insertion mutant has significantly increased polyphosphate content and a 4fold increase in the MIC of isoniazid relative to the wild-type. The mutant shows reduced survival at day 7 in activated and naive J774 macrophages relative to the wild-type. Naive mutant-infected macrophages show increased expression of interleukins IL-2, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, and gamma interferon relative to wild-type-infected macrophages. The mutant exhibits significantly lower lung CFU during acute murine infection <4>; #8# PPK2 plays a role in mycobacterial survival under stress.

In diploid organisms, haploinsufficiency is a phenomenon in which a single copy of a functional gene is not sufficient to produce the normal/wild-type phenotype. The patient is only heterozygous for the UAP1 A229T missense mutation. The UAP1 gene is potentially haploinsufficient and LoF intolerant, and the heterozygous UAP1 A229T mutation is potentially pathogenic. The recombinant mutant enzyme shows a reduction of the melting temperature (Tm) by approximately 5.3\u00b0C compared to wild-type. The A229T mutation induces structural changes. The R228-E44 interaction is abolished in the AGX1A229T structure caused by the position shift of R228. The pushing effect is likely due to the bulkier side chain of threonine compared to that of alanine. Along with the conformational change of the N-terminal domain in the AGX1A229T structure, M218 is shifted by 0.8 A away from R169, weakening the Q112-R169-M218 interaction\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

The enzyme binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING to induce type I interferons and other cytokines <6>; #4# catalytic product cGAMP-dependent activation of stimulator of IFN genes STING induces highly upregulated CXCL10 gene expression. Formation of a distinct STING dimer is induced by 25-cGAMP, but not 3,5-3,5cGAMP. DNase II-/- mice constitutively produce IFN-beta and CXCL10 and accumulate 2,5-cGAMP in their fetal livers and spleens. DNase II-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts produce 2,5-cGAMP in a cGAS-dependent manner during apoptotic cell engulfment. cGAS deficiency does not impair the STING-dependent upregulation of CXCL10 in DNase II-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts that is induced by apoptotic cell engulfment or DNA lipofection <13>; #3# cGAS is overexpressed in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes compared with osteoarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. TNFalpha stimulation induces cGAS expression in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Overexpression of cGAS promotes the proliferation and knockdown of cGAS inhibits the proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. cGAS overexpression enhances the production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases as well as AKT and ERK phosphorylation in TNFalpha-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes. In contrast, cGAS silencing inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases as well as AKT and ERK phosphorylation in TNFalpha-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes <15>; #3# cGAS is required for IFN-beta expression during chlamydial infection in multiple cell types. Although infected cells deficient for STING or cGAS alone fail to induce IFN-beta, coculture of cells depleted for either STING or cGAS rescues IFN-beta expression. Cyclic GMP-AMP produced in infected cGAS(+)STING(-) cells can migrate into adjacent cells via gap junctions to function in trans in cGAS(-)STING(+) cells <10>; #1# cyclic GMP-AMP synthase cGAS and interferon activated gene Ifi204, are both required for the STING-dependent type I IFN response to Francisella novicida infection. cGAS and Ifi204 cooperate to sense dsDNA and activate the STING-dependent type I IFN pathway. dsDNA from Francisella novicida is an important type I IFN stimulating ligand. cGAS\\x96STING signaling leads to activation of the absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome in response to Francisella novicida infection. The absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome is beneficial to the host during Francisella novicida infection, type I IFN signaling by STING and IFN regulatory factor 3 is detrimental to the host <11>; #4# exonuclease Trex1-/- mice exhibit autoimmune and inflammatory phenotypes that are associated with elevated expression of interferon-induced genes. Genetic ablation of cGas in Trex1-/- mice eliminates all detectable pathological and molecular phenotypes, including interferon-induced gene induction, autoantibody production, aberrant T-cell activation, and lethality. Even deletion of just one allele of cGas largely rescues the phenotypes of Trex1-/- mice. Deletion of cGas in mice lacking DNaseII, a lysosomal enzyme that digests DNA, rescues the lethal autoimmune phenotypes of the DNaseII-/- mice. cGAMP accumulates in mouse tissues deficient in Trex1 or DNaseII and this accumulation is dependent on cGAS <18>; #4# glutamylation and deglutamylation of cGAS tightly modulate immune responses to infection with DNA viruses. Polyglutamylation of cGAS by the enzyme TTLL6 impeded its DNA-binding ability, whereas TTLL4-mediated monoglutamylation of cGAS blocks its synthase activity. Conversely, carboxypeptidase CCP6 removes the polyglutamylation of cGAS, whereas CCP5 hydrolyzes the monoglutamylation of cGAS, which together lead to the activation of cGAS <17>; #3# Mycobacterium tuberculosis activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase cGAS in macrophages to produce cGAMP. cGAS localizes with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human cells and in human tuberculosis lesions.

The PmrAB two-component system consists of the PmrA response regulator and the PmrB sensor, which is able to sense Fe3+, activating the system. The PmrAB two-component system activation promotes a remodeling of lipid A and the core region by addition of 4-aminoarabinose and/or phosphoethanolamine. These PmrA-dependent activities are produced by activation of ugd, pbgPE, pmrC, cpta, and pmrG transcription. Lipid A profiles from wild-type and mutant strains, overview <16>; #8# the addition of PEA to lipid A by lipid A PEA transferase, LptA, is a major mechanism for resistance to polymyxin in Neisseria meningitidis since this species does not synthesize 4-aminoarabinose. The neisserial lipooligosaccharide phosphoethanolamine transferase A is required for resistance to polymyxin <17>; #13# the enzyme EptC serves a dual role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, FlgG, and the lipid A domain lipooligosaccharide with a pEtN residue <15>; #13# the enzyme EptC serves a dual role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, FlgG, and the lipid A domain lipooligosaccharide with a pEtN residue. The enzyme also catalyzes the addition of phosphoethanolamine to the first heptose sugar of the inner core oligosaccharide of lipooligosaccharide, a fourth enzymatic target. Modification of Campylobacter jejuni lipid A with phosphoethanolamine results in increased recognition by the human Toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 complex, along with providing resistance to relevant mammalian and avian antimicrobial peptides (i.e., defensins). Modification of surface structures with phosphoethanolamine by EptC is key to its ability to promote commensalism in an avian host and to survive in the mammalian gastrointestinal environment. Modification of FlgG is required for efficient flagellar production and motility <8>; #16# the enzyme is responsible for the transfer of phosphoethanolamine residues to the lipid A in several Neisseria meningitidis strains. In all meningococcal strains examined, each lipid A species contains the basal diphosphorylated species, wherein a phosphate group is attached to each glucosamine residue. Also elaborated within the population of lipopolysacchride molecules are a variety of phosphoforms that contain either an additional phosphate residue, an additional phosphoethanolamine residue, additional phosphate and phosphoethanolamine residues, or an additional phosphate and two phosphoethanolamine residues in the lipid A, mass spectroscopic analyses, overview <9>; #13# the enzyme modifies two periplasmic targets, a membrane lipid A and a flagellar protein. It is required for efficient motility and flagella production <20>; #11# the enzyme phosphoethanolamine transferase A is involved in the addition of phosphoethanolamine moieties to lipid A <2>; #1# the enzyme regulates the modification of phosphate moieties of lipid A, which may be substituted with L-4-aminoarabinose or phosphoethanolamine groups <14>; #2# the enzyme regulates the modification of phosphate moieties of lipid A, which may be substituted with L-4-aminoarabinose or phosphoethanolamine groups. The enzyme also regulates the catalysis of periplasmic addition of L-4-aminoarabinose to lipid A through glycosyltransferase L-4-aminoarabinose transferase (ArnT) <14>; #9# the PmrA-regulated pmrC gene product mediates the addition of phosphoethanolamine to the 1-position of lipid A and affect resistance to polymxin B <11>; #7# the PmrA/PmrB regulatory system of Salmonella enterica controls the modification of lipid A with aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine, the PmrA-dependent modification of lipid A with aminoarabinose and phosphoethanolamine is responsible for PmrA-regulated polymyxin B resistance <10>; #7# the two-component regulatory system PmrA/PmrB controls in part the modifications of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide with the addition of 4-aminoarabinose to the lipid A and phosphoethanolamine to the lipid A and core in response to the in vivo environment <11>; #17# Cronobacter sakazakii modifies its lipid A structure through the enzyme to avoid recognition by the host immune cells. Gene ESA_RS09200, encodes a phosphoethanolamine transferase that specifically adds a phosphoethanolamine to the 4-phosphate residue of lipid A, but is not regulated by the PmrA-PmrB system. The enzyme is active in cells grown at pH 5.0, not pH 7.0. Gene ESA_RS09200, but not ESA_RS16425, is required for phosphoethanolamine addition to the lipid A in strain BAA894 <22>; #18# Gram-negative bacteria survive harmful environmental stressors by modifying their outer membrane. Much of this protection is afforded upon remodeling of the lipid A region of the major surface molecule lipopolysaccharide. Addition of cationic substituents, such as 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) at the lipid A phosphate groups, is often induced in response to specific environmental flux stabilizing the outer membrane. ColR specifically induces pEtN addition to lipid A in lieu of L-Ara4N when Zn2+ is present <23>; #3# wild-type Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 has a survival advantage relative to a PEA transferase A (lptA) mutant in the human urethral-challenge and murine lower genital tract infection models.

The mutant forms a stable complex with GroEL. Residue Ala239 is located in helix alpha8 near the site that interacts with the variable arm of tRNASec, and is distant from the active site. The A239T variant binds tRNASec with less affinity compared to wild-type SepSecS, but its catalytic function is unaffected\n- T325S: naturally occurring mutation and site-directed mutagenesis, the mutation does not affect the binding affinity of the SepSecS-tRNA complex. The mutant does not form a complex with GroEL. Residue Thr325 is located in helix alpha12 and about 15 A away from the active site. The Thr325 to Ser replacement does not cause any changes in the tetrameric structure of SepSecS. Tetramers of T325S adopt the same structure as wild-type SepSecS. The pathogenic mutation Thr325Ser does not alter the three-dimensional structure of the SepSecS tetramer\n- Y334C: naturally occurring mutation and site-directed mutagenesis, the mutation does not affect the binding affinity of the SepSecS-tRNA complex. The mutant forms a stable complex with GroEL. The side chain of Tyr334 is in helix alpha13 near the active-site pocket. Its hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Asn285, and this interaction may help stabilize a loop that carries Lys284 and the covalently attached PLP cofactor. In the Y334C crystal, the side chain of Cys334 coordinates two water molecules, which interact with the backbone carbonyl of Asn285 in the same fashion as the Tyr side chain in the wild-type enzyme. Tetramers of Y334C adopt the same structure as wild-type SepSecS. The pathogenic mutation Tyr334Cys does not alter the three-dimensional structure of the SepSecS tetramer\n- Y429*: naturally occurring nonsense mutation and site-directed mutagenesis. Y429* expresses at low levels and as insoluble protein regardless of the incubation temperature, induction point, or the growth media used. Tyr429 is located before strand beta14. Premature abortion of protein synthesis yields a truncated enzyme devoid of strand beta14, loop beta14-alpha15, and the C-terminal helix alpha15. Loop beta14-alpha15 establishes a side of the catalytic groove, and helix alpha15 provides residues that bind the 5-end of tRNASec. The Y429* variant is not be capable of promoting selenocysteine synthesis\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.

Aprataxin hydrolyses abnormal 5-AMP DNA termini formed in abortive DNA ligations, it is an important DNA repair enzyme <17>; #3# aprataxin (APTX) is a DNA-adenylate hydrolase that removes 5-AMP blocking groups from abortive ligation repair intermediates. Primary role of aprataxin is processing of adenylated 5 ends. XRCC1, a multi-domain protein without catalytic activity, interacts with a number of known repair proteins including APTX, modulating and coordinating the various steps of DNA repair. CK2- phosphorylation of XRCC1 is thought to be crucial for its interaction with the FHA domain of APTX. A phosphorylated XRCC1 is required for APTX recruitment.No interaction of APTX with a phosphorylation mutant of XRCC1 <18>; #3# critical role of APTX in transcription regulation of mitochondrial function and the pathogenesis of AOA1 via a novel pathomechanistic pathway, which may be relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases <20>; #3# eukaryotic DNA ligases seal DNA breaks in the final step of DNA replication and repair transactions via a three-step reaction mechanism that can abort if DNA ligases encounter modified DNA termini, such as the products and repair intermediates of DNA oxidation, alkylation, or the aberrant incorporation of ribonucleotides into genomic DNA. Such abortive DNA ligation reactions create 5-adenylated nucleic acid termini in the context of DNA and RNA-DNA substrates in DNA base excision repair (BER), double strand break repair (DSBR) and ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). Aprataxin (APTX), a protein altered in the heritable neurological disorder ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1), acts as a DNA ligase proofreader to directly reverse AMP-modified nucleic acid termini in DNA- and RNA-DNA damage response, molecular mechanism, overview. Elongation of the wedge helix enables dynamic interactions with both the AMP lesion and the exposed base stack on the 5-end of the damaged DNA strand. The second major DNA binding interface involves undamaged DNA strand binding by the Znf domain <21>; #7# Hnt3 promotes formation of a repair intermediate that is resolved by recombination.

When an adenylated nick is encountered by APTX, base pairing at the 5 terminus of the nick is disrupted as the adenylate is accepted into the active site of the enzyme.

Primary sensory neurons, including the capsaicin-sensitive cells are capable of producing anandamide <19>; #5# the down-regulation of NAPE-PLD expression may be functionally important because mutant NAPE-PLD-null mice, in which this regulatory process is defective, are unable to mount a normal inflammatory reaction in response to carrageenan <16>; #5# the enzyme is involved in formation of N-acylethanolamines, membrane-derived lipids that are utilized as signaling molecules in the nervous system (e.g., the endocannabinoid anandamide). N-acylethanolamines generated by NAPE-PLD in axons may act as anterograde synaptic signaling molecules that regulate the activity of postsynaptic neurons <3>; #5# the enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of anandamide, an endocannabinoid that belongs to the class of bioactive, long-chain N-acylethanolamines. Analysis of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice reveals the presence of NAPE-PLD independent pathways for the anandamide formation <7>; #1# NAPE-PLD is involved in formation of N-acylethanolamines, e.g. include anandamide, N-palmitoylethanolamine,, and N-oleoylethanolamine, from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines in the brain <22>; #1# approximately 60% of cannabinoid-1 receptor-labeled axonal profiles oppose or converge with axon terminals containing N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D immunoreactivity. Cannabinoid-1 receptors in the mouse ventral pallidum have subcellular distributions consistent with on demand activation by endocannabinoids that can regulate the release of functionally opposed opioid peptides and also modulate inhibitory and excitatory transmission <26>; #5# deletion of NAPE-PLD does not alter the N-acylethanolamine levels of heart, kidney, liver, and jejunum. N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine levels except in jejunum are significantly higher in NAPE-PLD-/- mice than in wild-type mice. Glycero-3-phospho-N-acylethanolamine species having an acyl moiety with 22 carbons and 6 double bonds are enriched in these peripheral tissues. 18', 'generation and characterization of mice with a targeted disruption in the NAPE-PLD gene [NAPE-PLD(-/-) mice]. Brain tissue from NAPE-PLD-(-/-) mice shows more than a 5fold reduction in the calcium-dependent conversion of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines to N-acylethanolamines bearing both saturated and polyunsaturated N-acyl chains.

Wild-type kidneys grafted into wild-type recipients develop acute renal failure. Wild-type grafts transplanted into MASP-2-deficient recipients show significantly better kidney function, less C3 deposition, and less ischemia reperfusion injury. In the absence of donor or recipient complement C4, the wild-type to wild-type phenotype is preserved, indicating that the MASP-2-mediated damage is independent of C4 activation. In mice deficient for both MASP-2 and C4, the protection from postoperative acute renal failure is no greater than in mice with MASP-2 deficiency alone. Injury occurs through MASP-2-dependent activation events independent of C4 <54>; #6# mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 can readily form heterodimers after dissociation and re-association, however, in thepresence of Ca2+ exchange of subunits is slow between the homodimers.

In the case of E134D mutation, the shorter side chain length of the Asp residue at the 134 position (compared to Glu134 in the wild-type enzyme) makes the negatively charged carboxylate group of the Asp134 residue more distant from the negatively charged substrate, N-succinyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate. In addition, the metal centers contribute more favorably toward the substrate binding in the E134D mutant as compared to that in wild-type enzyme, which indicates a stronger substrate binding with the metal centers in the mutant. The increased metal-substrate binding in the E134D mutant is a result of the shorter side chain of Asp134, which allows the negatively charged N-succinyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate to come closer to the metal centers in E134D as compared to that in wild-type enzyme\n- H67A: the free energy of substrate binding in the mutant enzyme is compared with the substrate binding free energy in the wild-type enzyme. Compared to wild-type enzyme, a relatively weaker substrate binding is observed in the histidine mutant. The computed values of the free energy of substrate binding in this study suggest a less favorable substrate binding in the H67A mutant compared to wild-type enzyme\n- H349A: the free energy of substrate binding in the mutant enzyme is compared with the substrate binding free energy in the wild-type enzyme. Compared to wild-type enzyme, a relatively weaker substrate binding is observed in the histidine mutant Compared to wild-type enzyme, a relatively weaker substrate binding is observed in the histidine mutant.

Physiological role of AtNUDX19 using its loss-of-function mutants. NADPH levels are increased in nudx19 mutants under both normal and high light conditions, while NADP+ and NAD+ levels are decreased. Despite the high redox states of NADP(H), nudx19 mutants exhibit high tolerance to moderate light- or methylviologen-induced photooxidative stresses. The tolerance of nudx19 mutants to photooxidative stress is due to an enhancement in photosynthesis, increase in antioxidant capacity, and/or modulation of the expression of defense genes through changes in the levels and redox states of NAD(P), phenotypes, overview. AtNUDX19 acts as a negative regulator of SA synthesis. In contrast, KO- and KD-nudx19 plants are slightly insensitive to jasmonic acid methyl (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA).

Rac directly regulates the activity of the NADPH oxidase and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), important players of cardiovascular disorder. Rac1 facilitates the formation of the lamellipodia structures by initiating peripheral actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex that is activated by either the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family or the WAVE (WASP with a V-domain) family proteins. Rac1, through the calmodulin-binding GAP, that is enriched at the leading edge of migrating cells, influences the organization of microtubules, and thus cell shape and polarity. In addition to the cytoskeletal and microtubules effects, Rac1 regulates several signal transduction pathways that lead to alterations in gene expression. Cellular effects of Rac1 activation in cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes, overview <153>; #107# Rac1 is one of the biologically important genes in coronary heart diseases. Rac directly regulates the activity of the NADPH oxidase and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), important players of cardiovascular disorder <153>; #10# Rad is a Ras-related small GTPase shown to inhibit cancer cell migration, and its expression is frequently lost in lung cancer cells. Rad can negatively regulate the NFkappaB pathway. Rad-mediated regulation of NFkappaB is through an IkappaB-independent mechanism. Expression of a nucleus-localized mutant Rad is sufficient to inhibit the NFkappaB transcriptional activity, whereas expressing the scaffolding protein 14-3-3gamma to retain Rad in the cytoplasm alleviates the suppressive effect of Rad on NFkappaB. The Rad-p65 interaction primarily occurs in the nucleus. Rad may directly impede the interaction between RelA/p65 and DNA. Role of nuclear Rad in inhibiting the NFkappaB pathway function <147>; #103# remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton heavily relies on the regulation of RhoGTPases which have important and conserved roles in almost all its functions.

In order to develop an LDC enzyme from Selenomonas ruminantium (SrLDC) with an enhanced affinity for PLP, an internal disulfide bond between Ala225 and Thr302 residues is introduced with a desire to retain the PLP binding site in a closed conformation. The SrLDCA225C/T302C mutant shows bound PLP, and exhibits 3fold enhanced PLP affinity compared with the wild-type SrLDC. The mutant also exhibits a dramatically enhanced LDC activity and cadaverine conversion particularly under no or low PLP concentrations. Introduction of the disulfide bond renders mutant SrLDC more resistant to high pH and temperature. The formation of the introduced disulfide bond and the maintenance of the PLP binding site in the closed conformation are confirmed by determination of the crystal structure of the mutant.

A bchF and bchV double mutant is not viable, indicating that either bchF or bchV can partly substitute in the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyl a <1>; #2# deletion of bchF gene affects the composition of 31R/S-epimers in composite BChls c, the bchF-deleted mutant has nearly 100% R-stereochemistry in 8-ethyl-12-methyl- and 8,12-diethyl-BChls c, 9-12% S-stereochemistry in 8-propyl-12-ethyl-BChl c, and nearly 100% S-stereochemistry in 8-isobutyl-12-ethyl-BChl c <2>; #3# deletion of bchV gene affects the composition of 31R/S-epimers in composite BChls c, the bchV-deleted mutant has nearly 100% R-stereochemistry in 8-ethyl-12-methyl- and 8,12-diethyl-BChls c, 0-6% S-stereochemistry in 8-propyl-12-ethyl-BChl c, and very few 8-isobutyl-12-ethyl-BChl c <2>; #3# in the bchV knockout mutant strain, about 85% of the total BChl c is normal, except that the most highly methylated species (8-iso-butyl, 12-ethyl BChl c), normally observed in the wild-type strain, is absent. The mutant shows the changes in BChl c aggregation and absorption properties, light harvesting and growth at low light intensities are seriously impaired in the bchV mutant <3>; #3# the bchV-deletion mutant possessing only BchF shows a significant decrease of the S-epimers and accumulations of C3-vinyl BChl c species, while the bchF-inactivated mutant, which still has BchV as a sole hydratase, shows higher ratios of S-epimeric bacteriochlorophyll c than the wild-type strain. The heightened prevalence of S-stereoisomers in the mutant is more remarkable at lower light intensities and causes a red shift of the chlorosomal Qy absorption band leading to advantages for light-energy transfer.

The 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component A, an activator, and component D, the actual dehydratase. Component A, a homodimer with one [4Fe-4S]cluster, transfers an electron to component D, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe-4S] clusters and FMN, concomitant with hydrolysis of two ATP. From component D the electron is further transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. In the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated. After elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of ATP. The helix-cluster-helix architecture of component A forms an angle of 105\u00b0, which probably opens to 180\u00b0 upon binding of ATP resembling an archer shooting arrows <3>; #2# FldC is essential for the reductive metabolism of aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan <6>; #2# heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase, FldABC, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate in two steps']\nSUBSTRATES: (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactoyl-CoA\nPRODUCTS: (E)-4-coumaroyl-CoA, H2O\nMETALS/IONS: None\n\n\nPropose mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above.
