The muscle is an organ consisting of a tissue made up of various elongated cells that are specialized to contract and thus to produce movement and mechanical work.\n  - GO:0007519: skeletal muscle tissue development\n    Definition: The developmental sequence of events leading to the formation of adult skeletal muscle tissue. The main events are: the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes that increase in size by further fusion to them of myoblasts, the formation of myofibrils within their cytoplasm and the establishment of functional neuromuscular junctions with motor neurons. At this stage they can be regarded as mature muscle fibers.\n  - GO:0008150: biological_process\n    Definition: A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell.

For example, cell communication occurs among more than one cell, but occurs at the cellular level.\n  - GO:0030154: cell differentiation\n    Definition: The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state.\n  - GO:0032502: developmental process\n    Definition: A biological process whose specific outcome is the progression of an integrated living unit: an anatomical structure (which may be a subcellular structure, cell, tissue, or organ), or organism over time from an initial condition to a later condition.\n  - GO:0035914: skeletal muscle cell differentiation\n    Definition: The process in which a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of a skeletal muscle cell, a somatic cell located in skeletal muscle.\n  - GO:0048513: animal organ development\n    Definition: Development of a tissue or tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Development pertains to the process whose specific outcome is the progression of a structure over time, from its formation to the mature structure. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions.\n  - GO:0048856: anatomical structure development\n    Definition: The biological process whose specific outcome is the progression of an anatomical structure from an initial condition to its mature state. This process begins with the formation of the structure and ends with the mature structure, whatever form that may be including its natural destruction. An anatomical structure is any biological entity that occupies space and is distinguished from its surroundings. Anatomical structures can be macroscopic such as a carpel, or microscopic such as an acrosome.\n  - GO:0048869: cellular developmental process\n    Definition: A biological process whose specific outcome is the progression of a cell over time from an initial condition to a later condition.\n  - GO:0060537: muscle tissue development\n    Definition: The progression of muscle tissue over time, from its initial formation to its mature state. Muscle tissue is a contractile tissue made up of actin and myosin fibers.\n  - GO:0060538: skeletal muscle organ development\n    Definition: The progression of a skeletal muscle organ over time from its initial formation to its mature state. A skeletal muscle organ includes the skeletal muscle tissue and its associated connective tissue.\n  - GO:0061061: muscle structure development\n    Definition: The progression of a muscle structure over time, from its formation to its mature state.

There are two ways in which the gene ontology describes locations of gene products: (1) relative to cellular structures (e.g., cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane) or compartments (e.g., mitochondrion), and (2) the stable macromolecular complexes of which they are parts (e.g., the ribosome).\n  - GO:0005622: intracellular anatomical structure\n    Definition: A component of a cell contained within (but not including) the plasma membrane. In eukaryotes it includes the nucleus and cytoplasm.\n  - GO:0005634: nucleus\n    Definition: A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.\n  - GO:0005654: nucleoplasm\n    Definition: That part of the nuclear content other than the chromosomes or the nucleolus.\n  - GO:0016592: mediator complex\n    Definition: A protein complex that interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and plays an active role in transducing the signal from a transcription factor to the transcriptional machinery. The mediator complex is required for activation of transcription of most protein-coding genes, but can also act as a transcriptional corepressor. The Saccharomyces complex contains several identifiable subcomplexes: a head domain comprising Srb2, -4, and -5, Med6, -8, and -11, and Rox3 proteins; a middle domain comprising Med1, -4, and -7, Nut1 and -2, Cse2, Rgr1, Soh1, and Srb7 proteins; a tail consisting of Gal11p, Med2p, Pgd1p, and Sin4p; and a regulatory subcomplex comprising Ssn2, -3, and -8, and Srb8 proteins.

Neurotransmitters are any chemical substance that is capable of transmitting (or inhibiting the transmission of) a nerve impulse from a neuron to another cell.\n  - GO:0006887: exocytosis\n    Definition: A process of secretion by a cell that results in the release of intracellular molecules (e.g. hormones, matrix proteins) contained within a membrane-bounded vesicle. Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for exemple of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell.\n  - GO:0007154: cell communication\n    Definition: Any process that mediates interactions between a cell and its surroundings. Encompasses interactions such as signaling or attachment between one cell and another cell, between a cell and an extracellular matrix, or between a cell and any other aspect of its environment.\n  - GO:0007267: cell-cell signaling\n    Definition: Any process that mediates the transfer of information from one cell to another. This process includes signal transduction in the receiving cell and, where applicable, release of a ligand and any processes that actively facilitate its transport and presentation to the receiving cell. Examples include signaling via soluble ligands, via cell adhesion molecules and via gap junctions.\n  - GO:0007268: chemical synaptic transmission\n    Definition: The vesicular release of classical neurotransmitter molecules from a presynapse, across a chemical synapse, the subsequent activation of neurotransmitter receptors at the postsynapse of a target cell (neuron, muscle, or secretory cell) and the effects of this activation on the postsynaptic membrane potential and ionic composition of the postsynaptic cytosol. This process encompasses both spontaneous and evoked release of neurotransmitter and all parts of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Evoked transmission starts with the arrival of an action potential at the presynapse.\n  - GO:0007269: neurotransmitter secretion\n    Definition: The regulated release of neurotransmitter from the presynapse into the synaptic cleft via calcium-regulated exocytosis during synaptic transmission.\n  - GO:0008150: biological_process\n    Definition: A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell.
