The side chain of Leu-198 is located at the mouth of the active site hydrophobic pocket, and this pocket is required for substrate association. Hydrophobic-->hydrophilic amino acid substitutions at the mouth of the pocket decrease kcat/KM for CO2 hydration: the CO2 hydrase activities of Leu-198-->Glu, Leu-198-->His, and Leu-198-->Arg CAIIs are diminished 19-fold, 10-fold, and 17-fold, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme; however, the substitution of a compact aliphatic side chain for Leu-198 has a smaller effect on catalysis, in that Leu-198-->Ala CAII exhibits only a 3-fold decrease in CO2 hydrase activity [Krebs, J. F., Rana, F., Dluhy, R. A., & Fierke, C. A.(1993) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)]. It is intriguing that CO2 hydrase activity is not severely diminished in Leu-198-->Arg CAII, even though the side chain of Arg-198 blocks the hydrophobic pocket. Therefore, the bulky side chain of Arg-198 must be reasonably mobile in order to accommodate substrate association. Significantly, a residue larger than the wild-type Leu-198 side chain does not necessarily block the substrate association pocket; e.g., the side chain of Glu-198 packs against a hydrophobic patch, the net result of which is a wider mouth for the pocket.\n\nPositions 1 to 10 are disordered in the wild-type enzyme.\nPositions 16 to 39 are disordered in the wild-type enzyme.\nPositions 250 to 260 are disordered in the wild-type enzyme.\nH94, H96, H119 are involved with coordiunation of the zinc ion\n\na recent study from McKenna's group reported hCA II variants addressing both enzyme thermal stability and catalytic efficiency [21]. In particular, starting from a previous study which identified 10 possible mutations to produce thermostable hCA II variants [99], the substitution of three surface leucine residues (Leu100His, Leu224Ser and Leu240Pro) was used to obtain a triple hCA II mutant (named TS1) with enhanced thermal stability with respect to the wild-type enzyme of about 7 \u00b0C. This mutant was then used as starting point to obtain new derivatives with improved catalytic activity. Among these, the variant obtained introducing the contemporary substitutions Tyr7Phe and Asn67Gln retained the same thermal stability as TS1 but showed an improvement in rate constants of proton transfer by about six-fold with respect to the native enzyme [21]. These substitutions were chosen, considering that the double mutant Tyr7Phe/Asn67Gln was previously shown to have a nine-fold increase in the rate of proton transfer compared to the wild-type enzyme [100,101].\n            \n            It has also been noted that deletion of ~10 amino acid loops in CAII has led to greater thermal stability without harming catalytic activity\nMETALS/IONS: Zn+2\nACTIVE SITE RESIDUES (DO NOT MODIFY): H64, D19, T198, P200\nKNOWN MUTATIONS: W5A (Impaired activity, not rescued by 4-methylimidazole (4-MI); when associated with W-64.), Y7F (Enhanced activity.), Y7H (Reduced proton transfer rate.), N62A (Reduced activity.), N62D (Strongly reduced activity.), N62H (Reduced proton transfer; when associated with A-64.), N62L (Reduced activity.), N62T (Reduced activity.), N62V (Reduced activity.), H64A (Reduced CO(2) hydrase activity, rescued by 4-methylimidazole (4-MI).

We also know that the side chain of Leu-198 is located at the mouth of the active site hydrophobic pocket, and this pocket is required for substrate association. Furthermore, we are given information about the thermal stability and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, including the effects of specific mutations on its activity.\n\nThe KNOWN MUTATIONS section provides information about the effects of specific mutations on the activity of the enzyme. We see that some mutations, such as Y7F and H64G, have impaired activity, while others, such as Y7H and N67H, have reduced proton transfer rates. We also see that some mutations, such as A65F and A65S, have reduced activity, and that others, such as N67Q and N67L, have impaired activity.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can synthesize the following insights:\n\n* The active site of the enzyme is critical for its activity, and mutations that alter the active site can affect the enzyme's ability to catalyze the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and water.\n* The hydrophobic pocket at the mouth of the active site is important for substrate association, and mutations that alter this pocket can affect the enzyme's activity.\n* Some mutations, such as Y7F and H64G, may be more detrimental to the enzyme's activity than others, such as Y7H and N67H.\n* Deletions or insertions of specific sequences may help improve the stability of the enzyme, but these modifications should be carefully considered to ensure that they do not compromise the enzyme's activity.\n\nWith this information in mind, we can propose the following novel mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme:\n\n1.
