This method uses covalent peptide bonds between proteins. SpyCatcher and SpyTag are used as mediators of cyclization, and these components have been studied in many papers [12], [13]. The protein partner SpyCatcher and the peptide SpyTag are formed by the cleavage and manipulation of the CnaB2 domain of the FbaB protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. CnaB2 forms a spontaneous single isopeptide bond between Lys and Asp through the interaction of the preceding proteins and provides pH, thermal, and structural stability [14], [15]. In addition, DNA sequences encoding SpyCatcher and SpyTag can be recombinantly introduced into a DNA sequence encoding a protein of interest to form a fusion protein, which can be covalently linked through the SpyCatcher-SpyTag system [18]. Thus, the use of Catcher/Tag pairs can achieve bioconjugation between two recombinant proteins, which is limited or impossible with direct genetic fusion because of problems with protein folding, sub-optimal expression hosts, and specialized post-translational modifications [19].\nIn this paper, SpyCatcher and SpyTag were attached to both ends of hmCA to form a ring through a covalent bond, thereby developing a biocatalyst that can remain active at temperatures where normal proteins are inactivated. It is intended for the manufacturing of heat-resistant and robust enzymes.yAnother study that worked well: first_pagesettingsOrder Article Reprints\nOpen AccessArticle\nImproved Solubility and Stability of a Thermostable Carbonic Anhydrase via Fusion with Marine-Derived Intrinsically Disordered Solubility Enhancers\nby Byung Hoon JoORCID\nDivision of Life Science, Research Institute of Life Science, and Anti-Aging Bio Cell Factory Regional Leading Research Center (ABC-RLRC), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Republic of Korea\nInt.

The \u03b1-CA of Thermovibrio ammonificans (taCA) has emerged as a compelling candidate due to its high thermostability, a critical factor for industrial applications. However, the low-level expression and poor in vitro solubility have hampered further utilization of taCA. Recently, these limitations have been addressed through the fusion of the NEXT tag, a marine-derived, intrinsically disordered small peptide that enhances protein expression and solubility. In this study, the solubility and stability of NEXT-taCA were further investigated. When the linker length between the NEXT tag and the taCA was shortened, the expression level decreased without compromising solubility-enhancing performance. A comparison between the NEXT tag and the NT11 tag demonstrated the NEXT tag\u2019s superiority in improving both the expression and solubility of taCA. While the thermostability of taCA was lower than that of the extensively engineered DvCA10, the NEXT-tagged taCA exhibited a 30% improvement in long-term thermostability compared to the untagged taCA, suggesting that enhanced solubility can contribute to enzyme thermostability. Furthermore, the bioprospecting of two intrinsically disordered peptides (Hcr and Hku tags) as novel solubility-enhancing fusion tags was explored, demonstrating their performance in improving the expression and solubility of taCA. These efforts will advance the practical application of taCA and provide tools and insights for enzyme biochemistry and bioengineering.\nMETALS/IONS: Zn+2\nACTIVE SITE RESIDUES (DO NOT MODIFY): H64, D19, T198, P200\nKNOWN MUTATIONS: None ()\n\nFirst synthesize interesting insights you have from the GENERAL INFORMATION sections provided above (be specific in your notes). Then, propose NOVEL mutations to optimize the stability of the enzyme given the information above. If applicable, be creative with your modifications, including insertions or deletions of sequences that may help improve stability (make sure to have good reasoning for these types of modifications). Ensure that you preserve the activity or function of the enzyme as much as possible.\n\n****all reasoning must be specific to the enzyme and reaction specified in the prompt. cite scientific literature. consider similar enzymes and reactions****\n\nProvide detailed reasoning for each mutation, including the position number and the amino acid change (e.g., A23L means changing Alanine at position 23 to Leucine).assistant\n\n<think>\n\nFrom the GENERAL INFORMATION section, we know that Carbonic Anhydrase II (hCA II) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate and water. The enzyme is sensitive to temperature, and its activity is reduced at high temperatures.\n\nThe enzyme has several key active site residues (H64, D19, T198, P200) that are crucial for its catalytic activity. Any mutations in these residues should be approached with caution to avoid compromising enzyme activity.\n\nConsidering the studies mentioned, a novel mutation to optimize the stability of the enzyme could involve introducing a disordered peptide tag, such as the NEXT tag, to enhance protein expression and solubility. However, this may require a trade-off in terms of enzyme activity.\n\nAnother strategy could involve introducing a metal-binding site to stabilize the active site. Since Zn2+ is a metal ion that plays a crucial role in the activity of carbonic anhydrase, introducing a Zn2+-binding site could help to stabilize the enzyme.\n\nInserting a Zn2+-binding site could involve introducing a conserved Zn2+-binding motif, such as CxxCxxH, to the enzyme. This could involve introducing a small insertion or deletion to accommodate the new motif.\n\nOne possible mutation could involve introducing a Zn2+-binding site at position 150, where a conserved histidine (H150) could be introduced to bind the Zn2+ ion. This could involve a small insertion or deletion to accommodate the new residue.\n\nAnother possible mutation could involve introducing a disordered peptide tag, such as the NEXT tag, to enhance protein expression and solubility. This could involve introducing a small insertion of 10-15 amino acids, such as EEEEEEELEEEEE, to the N- or C-terminus of the enzyme.\n\nAlternatively, a novel mutation could involve introducing a proline (P) residue to the enzyme to enhance stability. Proline is a residue that can help to stabilize the enzyme by introducing a kink in the protein backbone, which can help to prevent protein aggregation.\n\nOne possible mutation could involve introducing a proline at position 220, where a conserved proline (P220) could be introduced to enhance stability. This could involve a small insertion or deletion to accommodate the new residue.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n\nBased on the GENERAL INFORMATION section, the following novel mutations could be proposed to optimize the stability of the enzyme:\n\n1. Introduction of a Zn2+-binding site at position 150:\n\t* Insertion of a conserved histidine (H150) to bind the Zn2+ ion.\n\t* Amino acid change: E150H\n\t* Rationale: Introducing a Zn2+-binding site could help to stabilize the active site.\n2. Introduction of a disordered peptide tag, such as the NEXT tag, to enhance protein expression and solubility:\n\t* Small insertion of 10-15 amino acids, such as EEEEEEELEEEEE, to the N- or C-terminus of the enzyme.\n\t* Amino acid change: insertion of EEEEEEELEEEEE at position 1 or 260\n\t* Rationale: Introducing a disordered peptide tag could help to enhance protein expression and solubility.\n3. Introduction of a proline (P) residue to the enzyme to enhance stability:\n\t* Insertion of a conserved proline (P220) to enhance stability.\n\t* Amino acid change: L219P\n\t* Rationale: Introducing a proline could help to stabilize the enzyme by introducing a kink in the protein backbone.\n\nThese mutations could be tested to determine their effect on enzyme stability and activity.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Yang, W., et al.
